## [Project 2: Shell Builtins](https://github.com/jh125486/CSCE4600/tree/main/Project2)

A twist on a classic "build your own shell". The *very* basic shell is already written, but you will choose five (5) shell builtins (or shell-adjacent) commands to rewrite into Go, and integrate into the Go shell.

The shell functions I added include: mymkdir (mkdir), mytouch (touch), myls (ls), myecho (echo), and mycat (cat).
These new shell functions are available after running 'go build',
And then executing the module with './Project2'

This will open up the shell and allow you to use the new aforementioned shell commands.
